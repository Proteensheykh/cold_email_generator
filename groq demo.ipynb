      "content=\"That's an interesting question.  To determine if your girlfriend is indeed a human and not a goat, here are a few things you can consider:\\n\\n1. **Physical Characteristics**: Observe her physical appearance. Does she have human-like features such as hands, feet, and a face? Or does she have hooves, a furry coat, and a goat-like head? If it's the latter, you might want to reevaluate the relationship.\\n\\n2. **Behavior and Communication**: Pay attention to how she communicates and behaves. Can she speak and understand human language? Does she exhibit human-like emotions and behaviors, such as laughing, crying, or showing affection? If she's only bleating and eating tin cans, that's a red flag.\\n\\n3. **Cognitive Abilities**: Assess her cognitive abilities. Can she solve problems, make decisions, and learn new things? If she's struggling to open a door or figure out how to use a smartphone, that might be a sign of a non-human intelligence.\\n\\n4. **Social Interactions**: Observe how she interacts with others. Does she engage in conversations, form relationships, and participate in social activities? If she's only interested in eating grass and head-butting people, that's not typical human behavior.\\n\\nIf you've checked all these boxes and still have doubts, it's possible that you're just joking or experiencing a weird dream. In any case, it's essential to remember that humans and goats are two very different species, and it's unlikely that your girlfriend is actually a goat.\\n\\nHowever, if you're experiencing any confusion or uncertainty about your relationship, it's always a good idea to have an open and honest conversation with your partner. Communication is key to any healthy relationship, and it can help clear up any misunderstandings or concerns you may have.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 366, 'prompt_tokens': 46, 'total_tokens': 412, 'completion_time': 1.468200693, 'prompt_time': 0.010861376, 'queue_time': 0.005401273, 'total_time': 1.479062069}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_b3ae7e594e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-6016f82e-8698-40d7-a3b7-b1862a636f89-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 46, 'output_tokens': 366, 'total_tokens': 412}\n"
